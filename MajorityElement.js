/*
 *Majority Elements
 
  Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears
  more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times.
 
  You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.
 
  Example 1:
 
  Input: [3,2,3]
  Output: 3
 
 Example 2:
 
  Input: [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
  Output: 2
 Thank you for your business! We look forward to working with you again.
